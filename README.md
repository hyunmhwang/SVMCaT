# SVMCaT
This R library is developed for analyzing Ca2+ signals with functions for 
- Identifying signal peaks
- Generating peak-level variables
- Training peak-level SVM model based on peak-level variables to differentiate normal and abnormal peaks
- Generating cell-level variables
- Training cell-level SVM models based on cell-level variables to differentiate normal and abnormal Ca2+ signals.

## Example Data
- Trained peak-level SVM model (XXX) and cell-level SVM model (XX) are provided with this package
- Test Ca2+ signals are provided (XXX) with this package

## See XXX for a demostration of using this tool
